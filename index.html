            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</h3>
                <p>Problems in nature can be categorized into different types such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeating a process multiple times, for example, iterating over an array of crops for irrigation planning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> A problem that calls itself repeatedly, such as breaking down the larger issue of crop management into smaller recursive tasks (e.g., dividing fields into sub-sections).</li>
                    <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> This approach is useful for exploring different possibilities, like trying different irrigation methods and backing out if a particular approach fails to optimize water usage.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h3>
                <p>Space and time efficiency are crucial in designing algorithms that handle large amounts of data efficiently. Time efficiency refers to the speed at which an algorithm executes, while space efficiency refers to the amount of memory it consumes. For example, when optimizing irrigation systems, we want the algorithm to run quickly and consume as little memory as possible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Take away from design principles (Chapter 2)</h3>
                <p>Chapter 2 emphasizes the importance of efficient problem-solving strategies. Principles like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms are essential. For example, using Dijkstra’s Algorithm for distributing crops optimally or applying dynamic programming for water usage planning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>How hierarchical data and tree data structures optimize problems?</h3>
                <p>Hierarchical data structures like trees (e.g., Binary Search Tree, AVL) are critical for organizing and managing data in agricultural systems. For instance, a farm’s crop yield data could be stored in a tree structure to optimize search times and ensure faster data retrieval for planning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>The need for array query algorithms</h3>
                <p>Array query algorithms, such as segment trees or Fenwick trees, are necessary for efficiently answering range queries, such as calculating total water consumption across a set of fields or determining crop yield within a given range of dates.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Difference between trees and graphs</h3>
                <p>Trees are hierarchical structures, ideal for applications like hierarchical crop data storage, while graphs are more flexible and are suitable for representing the transportation network in agricultural areas.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h3>
                <p>Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort are vital for organizing crop data for better management. Searching algorithms, such as binary search, help in quickly finding relevant information, like identifying crops that need more water.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Importance of Graph Algorithms</h3>
                <p>Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Prim’s algorithm are essential for optimizing transportation paths, ensuring crops are efficiently distributed, and minimizing transportation costs across fields.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Different Algorithm Design Techniques</h3>
                <p>Techniques such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms offer distinct benefits for problem-solving. For example, divide and conquer can break down complex issues like crop management into smaller, manageable parts for more efficient solutions.</p>

                <h3>Project Description (All Six Cases)</h3>
                <p>Our project addresses six critical challenges in agricultural management. Each business case is focused on improving specific aspects like water usage, transportation, waste management, and more. We apply algorithmic solutions like Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms, dynamic programming, and others to optimize each scenario.</p>

                <p>3. Business Case 3:No proper disposal of weeds	
                    <p>Description: Due to no proper disposal of weeds, they tend to grow again causing damage and more work for removal.

                    <p>4. Business Case 4:Unorganized distribution of harvested products	
                        <p>Description: When the crops are produced and further sent to the city for sale, some parts of the city receive more crops, and others less, failing to meet demand.
                            <p>Probable Tools: Heap, Dijkstra's Algorithm</p>
